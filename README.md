# HR-Employee-Analytics

## Objective
This HR analytics project aims to transform raw employee, training, recruitment, and survey data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in human capital management. The analysis helps HR leaders improve retention, optimize training investments, promote equity, enhance engagement, and strengthen workforce planning.

## Key Questions

   Calculate the average tenure (in years) for employees in each department and show the total number of active employees per department.

2. **Department Employee Count by Gender**  
   List each department with the number of employees broken down by gender.

3. **Training Participation per Employee**  
   Identify employees who have attended at least one training and return their total number of trainings completed.

4. **Average Engagement Score per Department**  
   Calculate the average engagement score for each department using the latest survey for each employee.

5. **Cities with Highest Satisfaction Scores**  
   Determine the top three states (or cities) where employees have the highest average satisfaction score.

6. **Training Effectiveness per Department**  
   For each department, calculate the average performance score improvement for employees after attending trainings.

7. **Employees Without Training but High Performance**  
   Identify employees who have not completed any trainings in the past year but have performance scores above 4.

8. **Retention Rate by Department**  
   Calculate the retention rate per department over the last two years and identify departments with below-average retention.

9. **Compare Performance and Engagement by Supervisor**  
   Rank supervisors by the average performance and engagement scores of their team members.

10. **Compare Experience and Performance Analysis**  
    Group employees by years of experience (0–3, 4–7, 8–12, 13+) and calculate the average performance and satisfaction scores for each group.
    
11. **Top Performing Employees by Department**  
   Determine the top 5 employees in each department based on overall performance rating, considering only those with at least two years of tenure.

12. **Gender Pay Gap Analysis**  
   Analyze the average pay (or pay zone proxy) between genders within each department and job title, ranking the largest gaps first.

13. **Comprehensive Workforce Health Dashboard**  
   Generate a summary table per department including total employees, average age, average tenure, average engagement, average satisfaction, retention rate, and gender ratio.
    

## Recommendations
After analyzing the data, the following recommendations were key:

**Prioritize Retention of High-Performing Employees With 2+ Years Tenure**  
1. Offer fast-track promotions and leadership training. 
2. Build succession plans based on top performers in each department.
3. Use high performers as peer mentors for skill development.
   
**Improve Retention Through Targeted Department-Level Interventions**  
1. Conduct exit interviews to identify root causes of turnover.  
2. Strengthen onboarding, coaching, and mentorship for high-exit departments. 
3. Review workload balance and supervisor effectiveness.

**Standardize Performance Evaluation Framework**  
1. Provide supervisors with calibration guides to reduce rating bias.
2. Introduce measurable KPIs tied to performance categories.
3. Run quarterly review cycles instead of annual-only assessments.

**Conduct Regular Gender Pay Equity Reviews**
1. Standardize salary bands within departments and job titles.
2. Identify roles with consistent pay gaps and address structural issues.
3. Ensure transparent promotion and compensation processes.


## Conclusions
This HR Analytics project provides a comprehensive view of employee performance, retention, engagement, compensation, and training effectiveness across the organization. By leveraging key metrics such as tenure, performance ratings, satisfaction scores, gender distribution, and department-level trends, the analysis highlights several important insights that HR leadership should act on to improve workforce health and organizational effectiveness.
